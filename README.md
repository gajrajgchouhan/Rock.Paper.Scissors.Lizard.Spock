Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock was created by Internet Pioneer
Sam Kass. All hail Sam Kass!
It's very simple, Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock,
Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
